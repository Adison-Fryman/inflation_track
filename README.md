Project to collect data on grocery costs and stock availability across multiple Walmart locations in the United States. 


Description: This project runs from main.py, it will supply the zip code to be entered into the site and then wait for the request string to be input into the Python Console/Terminal within the IDE. It will check various qualifications for the string, and while logging also output quick notes to the user about the quality of the data and any known issues. It will then tell you when it is complete and provide the next zip code. The locations are on a loop and when all locations have a provided string the program ends. 

Installation: (dependencies or requirements) Currently this needs to be run in and IDE. The string is far to long to put into the console.

Usage: 

1. Change zip, select locations.
2. Navigate to cart
3. Inspect page, 
4. Click "network" in Developer Console, 
5. Refresh page,
6. Sort by type, scroll to "fetch" current name starts with eb54d8(dee44) changes daily, size should be about 12.8+ kb, 
7. Click on the name, dictionary should start with : "({"data":{"cart":{"id":")"
8. Hit ctrl +shift+end, then ctrl + c
9. Paste into Python Console/Terminal

Configuration: None Currently

Roadmap for future development: I would like to automate this as much as possible, get a GUI set up so it is not in the IDE. The reality is that Walmart does not want bots on their webpage, so I have been using manual manipulation to navigate the webpage. There are some possible options with requests and API's, but at this time I am going to go forward with the data visualization and live dashboard creation. The program is working fine as it is and the data acquisition takes me about 10 minutes once a week. If I do find an efficient method of automation that does not break any laws or infringe on Walmartâ€™s rights, I would like to add more locations and not just food but other necessities.
